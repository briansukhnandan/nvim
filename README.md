# nvim
my config that i use at work everyday ðŸ˜Ž

## My specific tweaks
- I personally use the default `<leader>` key - `<space>`.
- However my config also works well if you prefer your `<leader>` key to be `,`!
- This config also integrates well with `Neovide` if that's your cup of tea. To increase/decrease scale use `<C-->` and `<C-=>`. By default scale will be set at `0.75`.

### Harpoon (Navigation)
Harpoon Superkey (`<HS>`) - `<leader>h`
- Quick Menu: `<HS>m`
- Mark File: `<HS>a`
- Next File: `<HS>n`
- Prev File: `<HS>p`

### Code-related
- Go to matching bracket / parentheses: `M`

### Telescope
Telescope Superkey (`<TS>`) - `<leader><space>`
- Find files: `<TS>f`
- Live Grep: `<TS>g`
- View Buffers: `<TS>b`
